# Fairness
]

Evaluate the rules of the game as well as the outcome. Allocations can be considered unfair for two reasons:

--

.pull-left[

.center[
### Substantive judgement of fairness
]

.center[
**Inequality of final outcome**
]

- *Income*: The reward in money (or some equivalent measure) of the individual’s command over valued goods and services.

- *Happiness*: Economists have developed indicators by which subjective wellbeing can be measured.

- *Freedom*: The extent that one can do (or be) what one chooses without socially imposed limits.


]

--

.pull-right[

.center[
### Procedural judgement of fairness
]

.center[
**How they came about**
]

- *Voluntary exchange of private property acquired by legitimate means*: Were the actions resulting in the allocation the result of freely chosen actions by the individuals involved? 

- *Equal opportunity for economic advantage*: Did people have an equal opportunity to acquire a large share of the total to be divided up?

- *Deservingness*: Did the rules of the game that determined the allocation take account of the extent to which an individual worked hard, or otherwise upheld social norms?

## Evaluating fairness
]

.center[
### Rawls’ veil of ignorance
]


1) **We adopt the principle that fairness applies to all people**

For example, if we swapped the positions of An and Bai, so that it was Bai instead of An who picked up $100, we would still apply exactly the same standard of justice to evaluate the outcome.

2) **Imagine a veil of ignorance**: 

Since fairness applies to everyone, including ourselves, Rawls asks us to imagine ourselves behind what he called a veil of ignorance, not knowing the position that we would occupy in the society we are considering. 

We could be male or female, healthy or ill, rich or poor (or with rich or poor parents), in a dominant or an ethnic minority group, and so on. In the $100 on the street game, we would not know if we would be the person picking up the money, or the person responding to the offer.

3) **From behind the veil of ignorance, we can make a judgement**:

For example, the choice of a set of institutions —imagining as we do so that we will then become part of the society we have endorsed, with an equal chance of having any of the positions occupied by individuals in that society.

# Fairness and Economics
]


Economics does not provide judgements about what is fair.
--
 But economics can clarify:

--

.pull-left[

- **How the dimensions of unfairness may be connected**: For example, how the rules of the game that give special advantages to one or another group may affect the degree of inequality.

- **The trade-offs between the dimensions of fairness**: For example, do we have to compromise on the equality of income if we also want equality of opportunity?

- **Public policies to address concerns about unfairness**: Also, whether these policies compromise other objectives.

Angela the farmer.

The diagram shows Angela’s feasible frontier, determined by her production function.

---

.center[
### A model of choice and conflict
]

Angela the farmer.

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f5-2b.png")
```

The best Angela can do, given the limits set by the feasible frontier, is to work for 8 hours, taking 16 hours of free time and producing 9 bushels of grain. At this point C, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is equal to the marginal rate of transformation (MRT).

---

.center[
### A model of choice and conflict
]

Angela the farmer.

```{r, out.width="65%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f5-2c.png")
```

The MRS is the slope of the indifference curve. The trade-off she is willing to make between grain and free time. The MRT is the slope of the feasible frontier: the trade-off she is constrained to make. At point C, the two trade-offs balance.


---
.center[

Angela has company. The other person is called Bruno; he is not a farmer but will claim some of Angela’s harvest.

--

```{r, out.width="60%"}

```

**The combined feasible frontier**: The feasible frontier shows the maximum amount of grain available to Angela and Bruno together, given Angela’s amount of free time. If Angela takes 12 hours of free time and works for 12 hours then she produces 10.5 bushels of grain.

**The distribution at point E**: At point E, Angela works for 12 hours and produces 10.5 bushels of grain. The distribution of grain is such that 5.25 bushels go to Bruno and Angela retains the other 5.25 bushels for her own consumption.

**An impossible allocation**: An outcome at H—in which Angela works 12 hours a day, Bruno consumes the entire amount produced and Angela consumes nothing—would not be possible: she would starve.

---

If Angela does not work the land, Bruno gets nothing. Bruno has a gun: he has the power to implement any allocation that he chooses.

--

```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f5-4a.png")
```

**The biological survival constraint**: If Angela does not work at all, she needs 2.5 bushels to survive (point Z). If she gives up some free time and expends energy working, she needs more food, so the curve is higher when she has less free time. This is the biological survival constraint.

**Before the short hours law**: Bruno makes a take-it-or-leave-it offer, gets grain equal to CD, and Angela works 8 hours. Angela is on her reservation indifference curve at D and MRS = MRT.

### Politics: Sharing the surplus

New law that limits working time to 4 hours a day, while requiring that total pay is at least 4.5 bushels.

**What Angela receives before legislation**: Angela gets 4.5 bushels of grain: she is just indifferent between working for 8 hours and her reservation option.

**The effect of legislation**: With legislation that reduces work to 4 hours and keeps Angela’s amount of grain unchanged, she is on a higher indifference curve at F. Bruno’s grain is reduced from CD to EF (2 bushels).

**The maximum joint surplus**: The surplus to be divided between Angela and Bruno is maximized where MRT = MRS, at 8 hours of work.

**Angela prefers F to D**: But Angela prefers point F implemented by the legislation, because it gives her the same amount of grain but more free time than D.

**Angela could also do better than F**: Compared to F, she would prefer any allocation on the Pareto efficiency curve between C and G.

**Angela can propose H**: At allocation H, Bruno gets the same amount of grain: CH = EF. Angela is better off than she was at F. She works longer hours, but has more than enough grain to compensate her for the loss of free time.

**A win-win agreement by moving to an allocation between G and H**: F is not Pareto efficient because MRT > MRS. If they move to a point on the Pareto efficiency curve between G and H, Angela and Bruno can both be better off.
