## **Short essay** :page_facing_up: 

A short essay applying concepts, models, and economic intuition to a real-world situation. 
For example: Do minimum wages increase unemployment? Are humans competitive by nature? Do gender inequalities are 'natural'?

The essay’s overreaching goal is that students show the acquired knowledge and tools to understand and provide alternatives to real-world problems.

Think of the essay as an op-ed (*column, éditorial*) where the student translates what she/he learned in the classroom to a broad audience.

Here you can find three examples on different topics: 1) [Why GDP as a measure matters](https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/four-reasons-why-gdp-is-a-useful), 2) [carbon taxes and climate change](https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/environmental-tariffs-carbon-taxes-on-imports-game-changer-by-daron-acemoglu-2022-07), 3) [racial inequalities](https://www.parisschoolofeconomics.eu/en/economics-for-everybody/for-a-wider-audience/5-papers-in-5-minutes/december-2021/unveiling-the-cosmic-race-racial-inequalities-in-latin-america).
