# (Philosophical note)
]

--

  - Everyone has their political or economic ideals!

--
    - Even economist. 
--
  We are humans and social beings.

--
    - We can agree on a benchmark or minumum of acceptable ideas (i.e. as long as they respect human rights)

# Economics: The dismal science

Misunderstandings and (really) bad communication:
--

> *"Neoclassical economics has become an unquestioned belief system and treats anybody who challenges the creed of self-righting markets and rational consumers as dangerous heretics"* 

--

> *"Complex mathematics is used to mystify economics, just as congregations in Luther’s time were deliberately left in the dark by services conducted in Latin."*
    
--

> **Responsible of 2008 Great Recession**.

# This class
]

--

  - What we are going to do in this (and the following) class?
  
--

  - Study concepts and models used to understand strategic and social interactions.
  
--

  - Ideally: See how economics is useful to provide answers to real world situations.

--

  - **Spoiler**: We will only have a better understanding. Unfortunately, we would not be able to fully know what happen, is happening, or will happen. But that's because there is uncertainty and we are humans `r emo::ji("smile")`
