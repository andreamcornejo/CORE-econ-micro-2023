### The Context for This Unit

- Firms with **market power** can set their own price.
- Market outcomes are generally **not Pareto-efficient**.
- In reality, many firms are price-takers:
  1. How does their behaviour differ from price-setting firms?
  2. Can competition improve market outcomes?

]

--

.pull-right[
### This Unit

- Model of interactions between price-taking firms and customers
- **Perfect competition** = special case of the model
- Similarities and differences between price-taking and price-setting firms

**Demand curve** = total quantity that all consumers together want to buy at any given price.

Represents the **willingness to pay (WTP)** of buyers.

---
.center[
## Supply curve
]

**Supply curve** = total quantity that all firms together would produce at any given price.

```

The first seller has a *reservation price* (lowest price at which someone is willing to sell a good) of 2, and will sell at any price above that.

If you choose a particular price, the graph shows how many books would be supplied (Q) at that price.
The supply curve slopes upward: the higher the price, the more students will be **willing to sell**.

.center[
## Equilibrium price

At the **equilibrium (market-clearing) price**, supply equals demand.

At a price P* = 8, the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded: Q* = 24. The market is in equilibrium. We say that the market clears at a price of 8.

At a price greater than 8 more students would wish to sell, but not all of them would find buyers. There would be excess supply, so these sellers would want to lower their price.

At a price less than 8, there would be more buyers than sellers—excess demand—so sellers could raise their prices. Only at 8 is there no tendency for change.

**Price-taking firms** cannot benefit from choosing a different price from the market price, and cannot influence the market price.

--

```{r out.width="50%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-5a.png")
```

The bakery has an increasing MC curve. On the AC curve, profit is zero. When MC > AC, the AC curve slopes upward. The other isoprofit curves represent higher levels of profit, and MC passes through the lowest points of all the isoprofit curves.

```

The bakery is a price-taker. The market price is $P^*$ = 2.35. If you choose a higher price, customers will go to other bakeries. Your feasible set of prices and quantities is the area below the horizontal line at $P^*$.

The point of highest profit in the feasible set is point A, where the 80 isoprofit curve is tangent to the feasible set. You should make 120 loaves per day, and sell them at the market price, 2.35 each.

Your profit-maximizing quantity, $Q^*$ = 120, is found at the point where $P^*$ = MC: the marginal cost of the 120th loaf is equal to the market price.

$$MC=P \iff (\textit{slope of isoprofit} = 0)$$

### Firm’s supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-6a.png")

When the market price is 2.35, you supply 120 loaves. **Note**: Firm chooses quantity, not price.

What would you do if the price changed? 

---
.center[
### Firm’s supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-6b.png")
```

If $P^*$ were to rise to 3.20, you could reach a higher isoprofit curve. To maximize profit you should produce 163 loaves per day.

---
.center[
### Firm’s supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-6c.png")

If the price falls to 1.52 you could reach only the lightest blue curve. Your best choice would be 66 loaves, and your economic profit would be zero. 

---
.center[
### Firm’s supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}

In each case, you choose the point on your marginal cost curve where **MC = market price**. Your **marginal cost curve** is your **supply curve**.

### Market supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7a.png")

There are 50 bakeries, all with the same cost functions. If the market price is €2.35, each bakery will produce 120 loaves.

---
.center[
### Market supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7b.png")
```

When P = 2.35, each bakery supplies 120 loaves, and the market supply is 50 × 120 = 6,000 loaves.

---
.center[
### Market supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7c.png")
```

At a price of 1.52 they each supply 66 loaves, and market supply is 3,300. The market supply curve looks like the firm’s supply curve, but the scale on the horizontal axis is different.

---
.center[
### Market supply curve
]

```{r out.width="65%", fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f8-7c.png")
```

If the bakeries had different cost functions, then at a price of 2.35 some bakeries would produce more loaves than others, but we could still add them together to find market supply.

The **producer’s surplus** on a unit of output is the difference between the price at which it is sold, and the MC of producing it. The MC of the 2,000th loaf is 1.25; since it is sold for 2, the producer obtains a surplus of 0.75.

There is a new equilibrium at point B with a price of 10, at which 32 books are sold. The increase in demand has led to a rise in the equilibrium quantity and price.

The market supply curve then shifts because of the fall in the bakeries’ marginal costs. The supply curve shifts down, because at each level of output, the marginal cost and therefore the price at which they are willing to supply bread is lower.

Back to *boulangeries*:

The supply curve has shifted down. But another way to think of this change in supply is to say that the supply curve has shifted to the right. Since costs have fallen, the amount that bakeries will supply at each price is greater—an increase in supply.

The effect of the fall in marginal cost is an increase in market supply. At the original price, there is more bread than buyers want (excess supply). The bakeries would want to lower their prices.

The supply curve can also shift due to **market entry/exit**.

If existing firms are earning **economic rents** and **costs of entry** are not too high, other firms may enter the market.

Example: Tax on salt.
```{r, out.width="50%"}

]

Example: Tax on salt.
```{r, out.width="50%"}

A 30% tax is imposed on suppliers. Their marginal costs are effectively 30% higher at each quantity. The supply curve shifts.

## Taxes: Welfare effects
]

Example: Tax on salt.
```{r, out.width="50%"}

The tax reduces the quantity traded to $Q_1$, and raises the consumer price from $P^*$ to $P_1$. The consumer surplus falls.

## Taxes: Welfare effects
]

Example: Tax on salt.
```{r, out.width="50%"}

The suppliers sell a lower quantity, and the price they receive falls from $P^*$ to $P_0$. The producer surplus falls.

]

Example: Tax on salt.
```{r, out.width="50%"}

A tax equal to $(P_1 – P_0)$ is paid on each of the $Q_1$ units of salt that are sold. The green rectangular area is the total tax revenue. There is a deadweight loss equal to the area of the white triangle.

- **Tax incidence**, the effect of a tax on the welfare of buyers and sellers, depends on relative elasticity of consumers and producers. 
  - The less elastic group bears more of the tax burden. 
  - Taxing depending on the context

- Taxes can still raise welfare if governments use tax revenue to provide beneficial goods/services.

### Example: Denmark’s butter tax

In 2011, Denmark introduced a tax (per kg) on saturated fat, which was equivalent to 22% of the average butter price.

```{r, out.width="55%"}

Initially the market for butter is in equilibrium. The price of butter is 45 kr per kg, and consumption of butter in Denmark is 2 kg per person per year.

- Between 1985-1995 there was no correlation between migration and tax rates
- In the period 1996-2008, after the Bosman ruling on free mobility was enacted, the correlation became strongly negative
 - countries with higher top earnings tax rates became less likely to have foreign players
- The mobility of players had a negative impact on the performance of football clubs of countries with high tax rates

## Perfectly competitive markets 
]

.pull-left[

A hypothetical market in which:

1. The good or service being exchanged is homogeneous
2. Very large number of potential buyers and sellers
3. Buyers and sellers all act independently of one another
4. Price information easily available to buyers and sellers

]

--

.pull-right[

Some characteristics:

- **Law of One Price**: All transactions take place at a **single price**.
- At that price, **the market clears (supply = demand)**.
- Buyers and sellers are all **price-takers**.
- All potential **gains from trade** are realized.

## Perfectly competitive markets: Caveats
]

.pull-left[

- Allocation may not be Pareto efficient **if assumptions do not hold**: We might not have taken everything into account

- **Fairness**: The distribution of total surplus depends on the **elasticities of demand and supply** (share of total surplus inversely related to elasticity)

- Hard to find price-takers in real life
  - Even when consumers can easily check the price of products (online shopping sites), prices of the same product differ

## Price-setters vs. Price-takers
]

.center[
Two different models of how firms behave:
]

| Price-setter (Monopoly) | Price-takers (Perfect competition) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| None or few substitutes      | Almost homogeneous good |
| $MC < P$   |  $MC = P$  |
| Deadweight losses (Pareto inefficient) | No deadweight losses (can be Pareto efficient) |
| Owners receive economic rents in both long- and short-run | No economic rents in the long-run |
| Firms advertise their unique product | Little advertising expenditure |
| Firms invest in R&D, seek to prevent copying | Little incentive for innovation |

---
.center[
## Summary
]

1) Model of price-taking firms

- **Competitive equilibrium** where demand = supply
- Firms maximize profits where **MC = Price**
- **Perfect competition** is a special case
- Comparison with price-setting firms

2) Used model to show how equilibrium can change

- **Exogenous shocks** to demand/supply or market entry
- Effect of **taxation** on surplus
