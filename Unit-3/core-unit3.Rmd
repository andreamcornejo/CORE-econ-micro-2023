As a student, you make choice every day:
--
 how many hours to spend studying.

--

There are many factors influencing your decision:

- how much you enjoy studying/working
- how difficult you find it
- how much your friends study

Alexei **production function**: $y = f(h)$

Translates the number of hours per day spendt studying (input of labor) into a grade (output).

$$y = f(h)$$

--

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5a.png")
```

The curve is Alexei’s production function. It shows how an input of study hours produces an output, the final grade.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5a.png")
```

If Alexei studies for four hours his grade will be 50, and if he studies for 10 hours he will achieve a grade of 81.


---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5c.png")
```

At 15 hours of study per day Alexei achieves his maximum possible grade, 90. After that, further hours will make no difference to his result: the curve is flat.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5d.png")
```

Increasing study time from 4 to 5 hours raises Alexei’s grade from 50 to 57. Therefore, at 4 hours of study, the marginal product of an additional hour is 7.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5e.png")
```

Increasing study time from 10 to 11 hours raises Alexei’s grade from 81 to 84. At 10 hours of study, the marginal product of an additional hour is 3.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5e.png")
```

As we move along the curve, the slope of the curve falls, so the marginal product of an extra hour falls. The marginal product is diminishing.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5f.png")
```

When Alexei studies for four hours per day his average product is 50/4 = 12.5 percentage points, which is the slope of the ray from that point to the origin.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5g.png")
```

At 4 hours per day the average product is 12.5. At 10 hours per day it is lower (81/10 = 8.1). The average product falls as we move along the curve. At each point the marginal product (the slope of the curve) is lower than the average product (the slope of the ray).

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

$$y = f(h)$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/figure3-5h.png")
```

The marginal product at four hours of study is approximately 7, which is the increase in the grade from one more hour of study. More precisely, the marginal product is the slope of the tangent at that point, which is slightly higher than 7.

### What can production functions tell us?

**1. Average product**: Average output per unit of input

$$ \frac{y}{h} = \frac{f(h)}{h} $$

**2. Marginal product**: Change in output per unit change in input. (*Evaluated at a given point, holding other inputs constant*

## Preferences
]

--

Choices depend on **preferences**:
--

- a description of the benefit or cost we associate with each possible outcome
--

- things we care about

--

Back to Alexei example: cares about grades but also about his free time. 


|     |	A |	B | F	| G | H	|	D	| 
| --- | ---	| ---	| ---	| --- |	--- |	---	| 
| Hours of free time | 15	| 16	| 17	| 18 | 19 |	20	| 
| Final grade | 84	| 75	| 67	| 60 | 54 |	50	| 

--

**Trade-off**: Choosing between alternatives, leaving at least one.

--

How to represent preferences? 
--
 Mapping them.
--
 Graphically and mathematically.
 
--

**Utility function**: $$U(t,y)$$
 
--

**Indifference curves**: show 
all combinations of goods that give 
the same **utility** (satisfaction) 

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6a.png")
```

--

Combinations A and B both deliver a grade of 84, but Alexei will prefer A because it has more free time.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6b.png")
```


At combinations C and D Alexei has 20 hours of free time per day, but he prefers D because it gives him a higher grade.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6c.png")
```

We don’t know whether Alexei prefers A or E. So we ask him: he says he is **indifferent**. Meaning he would feel equally satisfied with either outcome. He has the same **utility**.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6d.png")
```

Alexei says that F is another combination that would give him the same **utility** as A and E.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6e.png")
```

By asking more questions, we discover that Alexei is indifferent between all of the combinations between A and D.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6f.png")
```

These points are joined together to form an **indifference curve**.

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

$$U(t,y) = c$$

```{r, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-6g.png")
```

Indifference curves can be drawn through any point in the diagram, to show other points giving the **same utility**. We can construct other curves starting from B or C in the same way as before, by finding out which combinations give the **same amount of utility**.

---

.center[
## Indiference Curves
]

- **Indifference curves slope downward due to trade-offs**: If you are indifferent between two combinations, the combination that has more of one good must have less of the other good.

--

- **Higher indifference curves correspond to higher utility levels**: As we move up and to the right in the diagram, further away from the origin, we move to combinations with more of both goods.

--

- **Indifference curves are usually smooth**: Small changes in the amounts of goods don’t cause big jumps in utility.

--

- **As you move to the right along an indifference curve, it becomes flatter.**

--

- **Indifference curves do not cross**

At H he is only willing to give up 4 points for an extra hour of free time. His MRS is 4. As we move down the indifference curve, the MRS diminishes, because points become scarce relative to free time. The indifference curve becomes flatter.

**All combinations with 15 hours of free time**:
On the lowest curve the grade is low, and the MRS is small. Alexei would be willing to give up only a few points for an hour of free time. As we move up the vertical line the indifference curves are steeper: the MRS increases.

$$U(t,y) = c$$
--

Suppose both $t$ and $y$ change by small amounts $\Delta t$ and $\Delta y$. 
--
 The small increments formula for functions of two variables gives an approximation to the change in utility:

$$ \Delta U \approx \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} \Delta t + \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \Delta y$$
--

If the changes $\Delta t$ and $\Delta y$ are such that 1) $\Delta  \rightarrow 0$ and Alexei stays in the same indifference curve,
--
 then his utility does not change:
 
$$ \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} \Delta t + \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \Delta y \approx 0 \iff  \frac{d y}{d t} = - \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y}  $$
--

Then, **marginal rate of substitution (MRS)** is the absolute value of the slope:

$$ MRS = | \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} |  $$

# Opportunity costs
]

--

Choices are limited by **constraints** and involve **tradeoffs**
--
 (Studying example: higher grades vs. more free time).

--

The **opportunity cost** of an action is the net benefit of the next best alternative action.

--

Relevant whenever we study individuals choosing between alternative and mutually exclusive courses of action.

--

Example: 


> Imagine that an accountant and an economist have been asked to report the cost of going to a concert, **A**, in a theatre, which has a $25 admission cost. In a nearby park there is concert **B**, which is free but happens at the same time

--

.pull-left[
**Accountant**
The cost of concert A is your ‘out-of-pocket’ cost: you paid 25 for a ticket, so the cost is 25.
]

--

.pull-right[
**Economist**
But what do you have to give up to go to concert A? You give up 25, plus the enjoyment of the free concert in the park. So the cost of concert A for you is the out-of-pocket cost plus the opportunity cost.

]


$$ \textbf{Accountants} \neq  \textbf{Economist} $$

Suppose that the most you would have been willing to pay to attend the free concert in the park (if it wasn’t free) was 15.

--

**Economic rent**: A payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or *reservation option*)

$$max \; U(t,y)  \; s.t. \quad y \leq f(24-t) $$

If  $y = f(24-t)$, substitute the constraint for $y$ in terms of $t$ in the utility function:
$$ U(t,y)  =  U(t, f(24-t)) $$
--

Then, maximize $U$ with respect to $t$:
$$\frac{dU}{dt} =  \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} + \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \cdot  \frac{\delta y}{\delta t} = 0$$

--

We know that $\frac{\delta y}{\delta t} = -f'(24-t)$. Thus:
$$\frac{dU}{dt} =  \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} - \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \cdot  f'(24-t)  = 0$$

Then:
$$  f'(24-t) = \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \iff MRT = MRS $$

Imagine that you are looking for a job after you leave university.

 You expect to be able to earn a wage of $15 per hour.

We will assume that your spending —-that is, your average consumption of food, accommodation, and other goods and services-- cannot exceed your earnings.

The straight line is your budget constraint: it shows the maximum amount of consumption you can have for each level of free time.

]

```{r, out.width="65%"}

The slope of the budget constraint is equal to the wage, $15 (in absolute value). This is your MRT (the rate at which you can transform time into consumption), and it is also the opportunity cost of free time.

Your indifference curves show that your ideal job would be at point A, with 18 hours of free time and daily earnings of 90. At this point your MRS is equal to the slope of the budget constraint, which is the wage (15).

## Overall effect on labour choice
]

```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-19ae.png")

The rise in the opportunity cost of free time makes the budget constraint steeper. This causes you to choose D rather than C, with less free time. This is called the substitution effect of the wage rise.

---

.center[
## Overall effect on labour choice
]

```{r, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("imgs/f3-19af.png")

The overall effect of the wage rise depends on the sum of the income and substitution effects. In this case the substitution effect is bigger, so with the higher wage you take less free time.
