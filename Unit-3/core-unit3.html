 But there are disparities in free time and income across countries.

# Scarcity and choice: Key concepts
]

.center[
# Example: Students
]

--

As a student, you make choice every day:
--
 how many hours to spend studying.

--

There are many factors influencing your decision:

- how much you enjoy studying/working
- how difficult you find it
- how much your friends study

--

Positive relation between grades and number of hours studied, **ceteris paribus**

|     | **High study time (42 students)** | **Low study time (42 students)** |

Alexei **production function**: `\(y = f(h)\)`

Translates the number of hours per day spendt studying (input of labor) into a grade (output).

| |	|	| 	| |	|		| 	| 	|  |	 |	 |  |	 |  |  |  |

`$$y = f(h)$$`

--

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5a.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The curve is Alexei’s production function. It shows how an input of study hours produces an output, the final grade.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5a.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

If Alexei studies for four hours his grade will be 50, and if he studies for 10 hours he will achieve a grade of 81.


---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5c.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At 15 hours of study per day Alexei achieves his maximum possible grade, 90. After that, further hours will make no difference to his result: the curve is flat.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5d.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Increasing study time from 4 to 5 hours raises Alexei’s grade from 50 to 57. Therefore, at 4 hours of study, the marginal product of an additional hour is 7.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5e.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Increasing study time from 10 to 11 hours raises Alexei’s grade from 81 to 84. At 10 hours of study, the marginal product of an additional hour is 3.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5e.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

As we move along the curve, the slope of the curve falls, so the marginal product of an extra hour falls. The marginal product is diminishing.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5f.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When Alexei studies for four hours per day his average product is 50/4 = 12.5 percentage points, which is the slope of the ray from that point to the origin.

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5g.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At 4 hours per day the average product is 12.5. At 10 hours per day it is lower (81/10 = 8.1). The average product falls as we move along the curve. At each point the marginal product (the slope of the curve) is lower than the average product (the slope of the ray).

---

.center[
Alexei **production function**
]

`$$y = f(h)$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/figure3-5h.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The marginal product at four hours of study is approximately 7, which is the increase in the grade from one more hour of study. More precisely, the marginal product is the slope of the tangent at that point, which is slightly higher than 7.

---

### What can production functions tell us?

**1. Average product**: Average output per unit of input

$$ \frac{y}{h} = \frac{f(h)}{h} $$

## Preferences
]

--

Choices depend on **preferences**:
--

- a description of the benefit or cost we associate with each possible outcome
--

- things we care about

--

Back to Alexei example: cares about grades but also about his free time. 


|     |	A |	B | F	| G | H	|	D	| 
| --- | ---	| ---	| ---	| --- |	--- |	---	| 
| Hours of free time | 15	| 16	| 17	| 18 | 19 |	20	| 
| Final grade | 84	| 75	| 67	| 60 | 54 |	50	| 

--

**Trade-off**: Choosing between alternatives, leaving at least one.

--

How to represent preferences? 
--
 Mapping them.
--
 Graphically and mathematically.
 
--

**Utility function**: `$$U(t,y)$$`
 
--

**Indifference curves**: show 
all combinations of goods that give 
the same **utility** (satisfaction) 

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6a.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

--

Combinations A and B both deliver a grade of 84, but Alexei will prefer A because it has more free time.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6b.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;


At combinations C and D Alexei has 20 hours of free time per day, but he prefers D because it gives him a higher grade.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6c.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

We don’t know whether Alexei prefers A or E. So we ask him: he says he is **indifferent**. Meaning he would feel equally satisfied with either outcome. He has the same **utility**.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6d.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Alexei says that F is another combination that would give him the same **utility** as A and E.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6e.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

By asking more questions, we discover that Alexei is indifferent between all of the combinations between A and D.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6f.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

These points are joined together to form an **indifference curve**.

---

.center[
**Indiference Curves**
]

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-6g.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Indifference curves can be drawn through any point in the diagram, to show other points giving the **same utility**. We can construct other curves starting from B or C in the same way as before, by finding out which combinations give the **same amount of utility**.

---

.center[
## Indiference Curves
]

- **Indifference curves slope downward due to trade-offs**: If you are indifferent between two combinations, the combination that has more of one good must have less of the other good.

--

- **Higher indifference curves correspond to higher utility levels**: As we move up and to the right in the diagram, further away from the origin, we move to combinations with more of both goods.

--

- **Indifference curves are usually smooth**: Small changes in the amounts of goods don’t cause big jumps in utility.

--

- **As you move to the right along an indifference curve, it becomes flatter.**

--

- **Indifference curves do not cross**

The diagram shows three indifference curves for Alexei. The curve furthest to the left offers the lowest satisfaction.

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-7c.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

He would be willing to move from A to E, giving up 9 percentage points for an extra hour of free time. His marginal rate of substitution is 9. The indifference curve is steep at A.

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-7d.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At H he is only willing to give up 4 points for an extra hour of free time. His MRS is 4. As we move down the indifference curve, the MRS diminishes, because points become scarce relative to free time. The indifference curve becomes flatter.

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-7e.png" width="70%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

**All combinations with 15 hours of free time**:
On the lowest curve the grade is low, and the MRS is small. Alexei would be willing to give up only a few points for an hour of free time. As we move up the vertical line the indifference curves are steeper: the MRS increases.

**All combinations with a grade of 54**:
On the curve furthest to the left, free time is scarce, and the MRS is high. As we move to the right along the red line he is less willing to give up points for free time. The MRS decreases–the indifference curves get flatter.

`$$U(t,y) = c$$`
--

Suppose both `\(t\)` and `\(y\)` change by small amounts `\(\Delta t\)` and `\(\Delta y\)`. 
--
 The small increments formula for functions of two variables gives an approximation to the change in utility:

$$ \Delta U \approx \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} \Delta t + \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \Delta y$$
--

If the changes `\(\Delta t\)` and `\(\Delta y\)` are such that 1) `\(\Delta  \rightarrow 0\)` and Alexei stays in the same indifference curve,
--
 then his utility does not change:
 
$$ \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} \Delta t + \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \Delta y \approx 0 \iff  \frac{d y}{d t} = - \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y}  $$
--

Then, **marginal rate of substitution (MRS)** is the absolute value of the slope:

$$ MRS = | \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} |  $$

---

**Marginal utility of the exam grade**: 

$$ \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} = \beta \cdot  t^\alpha \cdot y^{\beta -1}   = \beta \cdot \frac{U}{y}$$

**Marginal rate of substitition**:

$$ MRS = | \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} | = \alpha \cdot \frac{U}{t} / \beta \cdot \frac{U}{y} = \frac{\alpha y}{\beta t} $$

]

As `\(t \uparrow\)` and `\(y \downarrow\)`

.center[
# Opportunity costs
]

--

Choices are limited by **constraints** and involve **tradeoffs**
--
 (Studying example: higher grades vs. more free time).

--

The **opportunity cost** of an action is the net benefit of the next best alternative action.

--

Relevant whenever we study individuals choosing between alternative and mutually exclusive courses of action.

--

Example: 


&gt; Imagine that an accountant and an economist have been asked to report the cost of going to a concert, **A**, in a theatre, which has a $25 admission cost. In a nearby park there is concert **B**, which is free but happens at the same time

--

.pull-left[
**Accountant**
The cost of concert A is your ‘out-of-pocket’ cost: you paid 25 for a ticket, so the cost is 25.
]

--

.pull-right[
**Economist**
But what do you have to give up to go to concert A? You give up 25, plus the enjoyment of the free concert in the park. So the cost of concert A for you is the out-of-pocket cost plus the opportunity cost.

]


$$ \textbf{Accountants} \neq  \textbf{Economist} $$

---

.center[
# Opportunity costs
]

Suppose that the most you would have been willing to pay to attend the free concert in the park (if it wasn’t free) was 15.

--

**Economic costs**: The out-of-pocket cost of an action

$$ \textbf{economic costs} = 25 + 15 = 40 $$

--

**Economic rent**: A payment or other benefit received above and beyond what the individual would have received in his or her next best alternative (or *reservation option*)

--

|   | **High value on A**  | **Low value on A**  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Out-of-pocket cost A | 25 | 25 |
| Opportunity cost of leaving B | 15 | 15 |

The figure shows the highest final grade Alexei can achieve given the amount of free time he takes. With 24 hours of free time, his grade would be zero. By having less free time, Alexei can achieve a higher grade.

At C the opportunity cost of an hour of free time is higher than at A: Alexei would have to give up 7 percentage points (the vertical change is −7) to increase his free time by 1 hour (the horizontal change is 1). The slope is −7.

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-10b.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

On the indifference curve IC1, all combinations between A and B are feasible because they lie in the feasible set. Suppose Alexei chooses one of these points.

---

.center[
## Optimal Decision Making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-10c.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

All combinations in the lens-shaped area between IC1 and the feasible frontier are feasible, and give higher utility than combinations on IC1. For example, a movement to C would increase Alexei’s utility.

---

.center[
## Optimal Decision Making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-10d.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Moving from IC1 to point C on IC2 increases Alexei’s utility. Switching from B to D would raise his utility by an equivalent amount.

---

.center[

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-10e.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

But again, Alexei can raise his utility by moving into the lens-shaped area above IC2. He can continue to find feasible combinations on higher indifference curves, until he reaches E.

---

.center[
## Optimal Decision Making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-10f.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At E, he has 19 hours of free time per day and a grade of 57. Alexei maximizes his utility: he is on the highest indifference curve obtainable, given the feasible frontier.

---

.center[
## Optimal Decision Making
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-10g.png" width="55%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

At E the indifference curve is tangent to the feasible frontier. The marginal rate of substitution (the slope of the indifference curve) is equal to the marginal rate of transformation (the slope of the frontier).

Maximize utility given the constraint imposed by the feasible set `\(\rightarrow\)` **Constrained optimization**
]
$$max \; U(t,y)  \; s.t. \quad y \leq f(24-t) $$
--

If  `\(y = f(24-t)\)`, substitute the constraint for `\(y\)` in terms of `\(t\)` in the utility function:
$$ U(t,y)  =  U(t, f(24-t)) $$
--

Then, maximize `\(U\)` with respect to `\(t\)`:
`$$\frac{dU}{dt} =  \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} + \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \cdot  \frac{\delta y}{\delta t} = 0$$`

--

We know that `\(\frac{\delta y}{\delta t} = -f'(24-t)\)`. Thus:
`$$\frac{dU}{dt} =  \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} - \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \cdot  f'(24-t)  = 0$$`
--

Then:
$$  f'(24-t) = \frac{\delta U}{\delta t} / \frac{\delta U}{\delta y} \iff MRT = MRS $$

# Example: Working hours

Imagine that you are looking for a job after you leave university.
--
 You expect to be able to earn a wage of $15 per hour. 
--
 Jobs differ according to the number of hours you have to work.
 
--

We will assume that your spending —-that is, your average consumption of food, accommodation, and other goods and services-- cannot exceed your earnings.

| Consumption, `\(c\)` | 0	| 30	| 60	| 90 | 120 |	150	| 180	| 210	| 240 |


---

.center[
`$$w = 15 \; \Rightarrow c = 15(24-t)$$` 
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-15a.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The straight line is your budget constraint: it shows the maximum amount of consumption you can have for each level of free time.

---

.center[
`$$w = 15 \; \Rightarrow c = 15(24-t)$$` 
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-15a.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The slope of the budget constraint is equal to the wage, $15 (in absolute value). This is your MRT (the rate at which you can transform time into consumption), and it is also the opportunity cost of free time.

---

.center[
`$$w = 15 \; \Rightarrow c = 15(24-t)$$` 
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-15c.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The budget constraint is your feasible frontier, and the area below it is the feasible set.

]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-15d.png" width="65%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Your indifference curves show that your ideal job would be at point A, with 18 hours of free time and daily earnings of 90. At this point your MRS is equal to the slope of the budget constraint, which is the wage (15).
`$$MRS = MRT=w$$`

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-19aa.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

When the wage is 15 your best choice of hours and consumption is at point A. The steeper line shows your new budget constraint when the wage rises to 25. Your feasible set has expanded.

.center[
## Overall effect on labour choice
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-19ab.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

Point D on `\(IC_4\)` gives you the highest utility. At point D, your MRS is equal to the new wage, 25. You have only 17 hours of free time, but your consumption has risen to 175.


---

.center[
## Overall effect on labour choice
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-19ac.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The dotted line shows what would happen if you had enough income to reach `\(IC_4\)` without a change in the opportunity cost of free time. You would choose C, with more free time.

---

.center[
## Overall effect on labour choice
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-19ad.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The shift from A to C is called the income effect of the wage rise; on its own it would cause you to take more free time.

---

.center[
## Overall effect on labour choice
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-19ae.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The rise in the opportunity cost of free time makes the budget constraint steeper. This causes you to choose D rather than C, with less free time. This is called the substitution effect of the wage rise.

---

.center[
## Overall effect on labour choice
]

&lt;img src="imgs/f3-19af.png" width="60%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

The overall effect of the wage rise depends on the sum of the income and substitution effects. In this case the substitution effect is bigger, so with the higher wage you take less free time.
